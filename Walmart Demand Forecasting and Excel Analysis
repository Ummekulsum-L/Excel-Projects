Walmart Demand Forecasting and Analysis

Introduction: 

Walmart, a leading retail giant in the United States, is actively pursuing the development of a sophisticated demand forecasting algorithm to predict sales trends and customer demand accurately. The company faces significant challenges stemming from unforeseen fluctuations in consumer demand, occasionally resulting in stockouts. To address these challenges, Walmart recognizes the need for an advanced forecasting model capable of integrating various influential factors, including economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Unemployment Index. Moreover, Walmart strategically orchestrates promotional markdown events throughout the year, often preceding major holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. These markdowns play a pivotal role in driving sales but pose a challenge in accurately modeling their impact, particularly during holiday weeks when historical data may be limited. To mitigate this challenge, Walmart emphasizes the importance of significantly weighing holiday weeks in the evaluation process, reflecting their heightened significance in driving sales performance. A key focus of Walmart's strategic initiatives is revitalizing its in-house brand, Great Value, encompassing a diverse portfolio of products spanning multiple categories, including home and lifestyle, health and beauty, and food. As part of a comprehensive rebranding effort, Walmart continuously introduces new products under the Great Value umbrella, supported by substantial promotional budgets and strategic pricing strategies. Central to Walmart's approach is developing a robust demand estimation algorithm tailored to the unique characteristics of the Great Value product line. This algorithm is critical in guiding decisions related to advertisement budgets, product introductions, and pricing strategies, leveraging projected demand forecasts to optimize marketing efforts and enhance profitability. Walmart recognizes the importance of understanding demand fluctuations within specific product categories across different quarters and seasons, such as home and lifestyle. The company is committed to implementing advanced time series forecasting techniques to achieve this objective. By leveraging historical sales data and identifying seasonal patterns, Walmart aims to gain actionable insights that enable proactive decision-making and strategic alignment with evolving consumer preferences. In essence, Walmart's efforts to improve demand forecasting and optimization reflect its dedication to achieving sustainable growth and increasing customer satisfaction. By integrating advanced analytical techniques and strategic insights, Walmart aims to strengthen its position as a market leader and provide excellent value to its customers and stakeholders.
