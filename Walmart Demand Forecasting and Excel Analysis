Walmart Demand Forecasting and Analysis

Introduction: 

Walmart, a major retail leader in the United States, is developing a demand forecasting algorithm to better predict sales trends and customer demand. The company faces challenges from unexpected shifts in consumer demand, which can lead to stockouts. To address this, Walmart is creating an advanced model that factors in economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Unemployment Index.

Walmart organizes promotional markdown events during key holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. While these events drive sales, they complicate forecasting, especially during holiday weeks with limited historical data. Consequently, Walmart emphasizes the importance of evaluating holiday weeks for their significant impact on sales.

A key initiative is revitalizing its in-house brand, Great Value, which includes products across various categories such as home, health, and food. Walmart is continuously introducing new items under this brand, supported by promotional budgets and strategic pricing.

To optimize decision-making related to advertising, product launches, and pricing, Walmart is developing a robust demand estimation algorithm specifically for the Great Value line. The company is also focused on understanding demand fluctuations across different seasons and product categories by employing advanced time series forecasting techniques. 

Overall, Walmart's efforts to enhance demand forecasting reflect its commitment to sustainable growth and customer satisfaction, aiming to strengthen its market position while providing exceptional value to customers and stakeholders.
